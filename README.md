# Predictive_Modeling
This is a predictive modeling project using R and the Pisa2009 dataset. It was originally a class homework.
I wrote the first version on July 2021 and found that there were something wrong, so I editted it and uploaded the final version.
I tried to predict the model by integrating all the basic modeling knowledge I learned in this class. Maybe I will modify the model after I learn more about machine learning and data science.
Please feel free to offer suggestions and thoughts!
